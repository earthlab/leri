The leri R package facilitates access to the NOAA [Landscape Evaporative 
Response Index](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/leri/) data product.

## Installation

You can install the development version of leri with devtools:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earthlab/leri")
```

Or, you can install the stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("leri")
```


## Example

The LERI product is available from the year 2000 to present at a 1 km spatial 
resolution over the continental United States, at the following timescales: 

- 1, 3, 7, and 12 month
- 8 day accumulated or non-accumulated during the growing season (April - Oct.)

If we were interested in medium term drought, we could get 3 month timescale
LERI data for a particular date as follows: 

```{r example}
library(leri)
r <- get_leri(date = "2018-09-01", product = "3 month")
r
```

The `get_leri` function will download the NetCDF files from the NOAA ftp server 
and read them as `RasterStack` objects, which facilitates any other operations
that users may need via the `raster` package. 
For example, we could plot the data using the `raster::plot` function: 

```{r plot-leri}
library(raster)
library(viridis)

plot(r, col = cividis(10, direction = -1), 
     main = "3 month LERI data for 2018-09-01")
```
